# El Sheikh Zayed Property Data Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to my El Sheikh Zayed Property Data Analysis project! ðŸš€ this project aims to unravel the secrets hidden in property data.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two phases:

### Phase 1: Data Extraction and Cleaning

- Used Selenium for web scraping, gathering data from 300 pages on propertyfinder.com.
- Employed Beautiful Soup to transform raw data into a clean CSV dataset.
- Utilized Pandas for data cleaningâ€”handled outliers, duplicates, and null values.
- Added an extra feature for enhanced analysis.

### Phase 1 Continued: Exploratory Data Analysis

- Explored data distributions and correlations using Dataprep.
- Made strategic decisions on column selection for upcoming model training.

### Phase 1 Continued: Model Training

- Trained a Linear Regression model on 80% of the cleaned data.
- Identified 'Total Price' as the target feature, achieving an impressive R-squared score of 0.8.

### Phase 2: In Progress

- Building dynamic dashboards with Tableau and Power BI for insightful visualizations.
- Crafting a user-friendly website for easy property price predictions based on user inputs.
- Exploring AWS for model deployment.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your projects. Here's a brief guide:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks for detailed insights into each phase.
4. Run the scripts to replicate the analysis.

## Note:
- The notebook includes the code needed to scrap the website and therefore create the dataset before starting to clean it etc... If you need the ready dataset you can download the .csv file directly and use it.
- The insights displayed in dataprep's report are not visible in the github preview you would need to download the notebook to see them

## Future Updates

Stay tuned for more updates as Phase 2 unfolds. The journey continues!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
